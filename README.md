# RDMSamples-ps
Remote Desktop Manager (RDM) samples of PowerShell code.

The repository is divided in two areas:

## custom_batch_actions
Small fragments of PowerShell code that are used mostly in RDM's "Edit -> Edit (special actions) -> Custom PowerShell command". This offers a simple interactive method to run a snippet of code on currently selected entries. 
## module
Scripts that make use of our Remote Desktop Manager PowerShell Module. It allows for greater control but at the cost of more complexity. You should note that the snippets available in the ***custom_batch_actions*** area are usable in scripts. When looking for information on how to handle a specific field of one of our entries, it's recommended to look in the whole repository.
